Inquiry about feedback on my research on cellular automata and the universe

Dear Professor 't Hooft,

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Alexandre Furtado Neto, and I have been conducting independent research exploring the possibility of modeling fundamental aspects of the universe using cellular automata. Inspired by foundational ideas from computational physics and discrete models of spacetime, and in particular the many papers you wrote about the subject, my work aims to investigate how complex physical behavior might emerge from simple local rules.

Given your expertise in the foundations of physics, I would be truly honored if you could take a brief look at my work. I believe your perspective could offer invaluable insights, and I would greatly appreciate any comments or suggestions you might have.

If you're open to it, Iâ€™d be glad to send you a short summary or the full manuscript, depending on your availability.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Warm regards,

Alexandre Furtado Neto
