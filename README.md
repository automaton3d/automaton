# Recovery of global symmetries in a 't Hooftian universe
I'm developing toy model of the universe using the cellular automaton paradigm. The detailed research ideas are contained in this <A HREF="https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202107.0513/v2">pdf</A> file.

Here I present my efforts to implement a tiny version (in computational terms only because the rules are independent of the memory size of the model) of the universal automaton described in the aforementioned document, mixing Cuda and OpenGL.

This program is being developed under Visual Studio with Cuda Toolkit 7.5 under Windows 10. The GPU used is an NVIDIA GTX 1050 super.

I'm an independent researcher. My link to the Research Gate portal is

The immediate goals of this computational implementation are
* Compute the Poincar√© Cycle for sizes SIDE=8, SIDE=16 and SIDE=32 (the universe is SIDE=2 to 212 power);
* Check charge quantization for SIDE=32.

To achieve even these simple goals, I need lots of computational power, far beyond my limited budget. Notice that I do not receive funds from any university, so your help will be very valuable :)
