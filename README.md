# It from bit — a concrete attempt

Hi all,

I'm developing a toy model of the universe using the cellular automaton paradigm. The detailed research ideas are contained in this <A HREF="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3818302">pdf</A> file.

Here I present my efforts to implement a tiny version (in computational terms only because the rules are independent of the memory size of the model) of the universal automaton described in the aforementioned document. A program is being developed in the C++ programming language. The most important files are in the <I>model</I> directory, that contains the automaton algorithm.

I'm an independent researcher. My link to the Research Gate portal is

The immediate goals of this computational implementation are
* Compute the Poincaré Cycle for sizes L=8, L=16 and L=32 (the universe is L=2 to 269 power);
* Check charge quantization for L=32;
* Plot the entropy cycle.

I am passionately dedicated to achieving ambitious goals with my GitHub project, and to make this a reality, I require substantial computational power that exceeds my current budget. As an independent developer without funding from any university or organization, I rely on the generous support of contributors like you.
