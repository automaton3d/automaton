# It from bit - a concrete attempt
I'm developing toy model of the universe using the cellular automaton paradigm. The detailed research ideas are contained in this <A HREF="https://zenodo.org/record/5070295#.YPGLDD2SmM8">pdf</A> file.

Here I present my efforts to implement a tiny version of the universal automaton using Cuda.

This program is being developed under Visual Studio with Cuda Toolkit 7.5 under Windows 10.

The GPU used is an NVIDIA GTX 1050 super.

Your help will be very valuable :)
