# It from bit — a concrete attempt
Hi all,

I'm developing a toy model of the universe using the cellular automaton paradigm. The detailed research ideas are contained in this <A HREF="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3818302">pdf</A> file.

Here I present my efforts to implement a tiny version (in computational terms only because the rules are independent of the memory size of the model) of the universal automaton described in the aforementioned document. A program is being developed in the C++ programming language using CDT. The most important files are in the model directory, that contains the automaton algorithm.

I'm an independent researcher. My link to the Research Gate portal is

The immediate goals of this computational implementation are
* Compute the Poincaré Cycle for sizes SIDE=8, SIDE=16 and SIDE=32 (the universe is SIDE=2 to 269 power);
* Check charge quantization for SIDE=32;
* Plot the entropy cycle.

To achieve even these simple goals, I need lots of computational power, far beyond my limited budget. Notice that I do not receive funds from any university, so your <a href="https://patreon.com/user?u=60332830">help</a> will be very valuable :)
