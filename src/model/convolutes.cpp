 *
 * Convolution rules for each scenario (Sect. 5.4 of the manuscript).
 *
 * During the CONVOL phase (k < CONVOL), the CA compares each cell against
 * its mirror counterpart (cyclically shifted in the W dimension) to detect
 * wavefront crossings and trigger interactions.
 *
 * The scenarios form a progressive test suite: each one isolates a single
 * mechanism of the CA so it can be validated independently before enabling
 * the full rule set.
 *
 * Common gate condition (scenarios 1-5):
 *   d == effective_t(t)   — cell is on the active wavefront
 *   effective_t(t) == RMAX/2  — wavefront is at mid-radius (half expansion)
 *   x[3] == 0             — only layer 0 (w = 0)
 *   ctrl                  — fire-once flag (prevents re-triggering)
